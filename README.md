# Backend Portfolio — Static Site

A minimal, high-end static portfolio by Kiptoo Darius. Dark-first, performance-focused, and intentionally understated — designed to communicate technical competence and production experience without marketing fluff.

This repository contains a small set of production-ready static files:
- `index.html`— main page markup and structure
- `styles.css`  — modular, variable-driven CSS (dark-first)
- `main.js` — tiny, dependency-free interaction script
- `assets/` — images and static assets
.
